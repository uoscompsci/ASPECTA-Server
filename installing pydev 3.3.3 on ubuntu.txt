Step 1:

In newer versions of Eclipse:

In the Eclipse menu go to "Help" -> "Install New Software" and use the source:

http://pydev.org/updates

To download PyDev 3.3.3. This will fail if the version of Eclipse is too old.

In older versions of Eclipse (also works with newer ones):

Go to the PyDev website (http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html) and download the zip file for Pydev 3.3.3

Navigate to ~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.7.0_155965261/ and create a folder called "dropins". Copy the contents of the downloaded zip file to this new folder.

Step 2:

PyDev will now be installed, but wont do anything until you download Java 7, so you need to type the following commands into a terminal:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-set-default

Step 3:

Java 7 will now be installed, but it is possible that Eclipse will no longer start. If this is the case you need to type the following into the terminal on 32-bit systems:

ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libswt-* ~/.swt/lib/linux/x86/

Or the following on 64-bit systems:

ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libswt-* ~/.swt/lib/linux/x86_64/

PyDev should now be working fully in Eclipse.
